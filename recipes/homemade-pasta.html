        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store â€” and it's surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This homemade pasta recipe starts with two cups of all-purpose flour. </li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs lend fat and moisture to the pasta dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Two tablespoons of olive oil add moisture and help the dough come together.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A teaspoon of salt takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Add just enough water to form a smooth, thick dough.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade pasta:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out and knead it for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rest.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into balls.</li>
            <li>Use a pasta machine to roll and cut the dough into desired shapes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to Cook Homemade Pasta</h3>
        <p>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil, add the uncooked pasta, and stir. Cook until the pasta is al dente (until it has a slight bite).</p>
